Tea is grown mostly on the slopes of hills. Much rainfall is necessary for growing tea. It must also be ensured that rainwater does not stand at the root of the tea plants. So, most of the tea gardens are in hilly regions. There are also some tea gardens on plain lands where rainwater does not stand. In Bangladesh most of the tea gardens are in Sylhet division.
There are also some tea gardens in the Chittagong division. There are more than 150 tea gardens in Bangladesh. Some other countries like China, Indonesia and India also grow tea.
